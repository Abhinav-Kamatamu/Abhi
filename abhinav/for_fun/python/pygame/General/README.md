# Directory Summary

`fade.py` is the standardized code that I use to have a smooth fade between screens in a game.

Here are a few meaningless games that I developed.

- `Drawing.py` just draws lines and follows the mouse.


- `Spot_Clicker.py` is heavily inspired from the google doodle "Scoville".


- `Try.py` is just another colour picker.
