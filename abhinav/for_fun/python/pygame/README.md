# Directory Summary


This is where I used to spend most of my time. **Pygame** is a Python library used for game development. Most of my free time went into leveraging Pygame to create fun games and learning Python along the way.

-  `Blocks` was one of my first programs and is supposed to fun game to play.


-  `HitTheThing` is my version of Whac-A-Mole.


-  `Memory_Game` is a game that challenges your memory capacity and is very fun to play


- `Chess` is a temporary folder I maintained while making my Chess game. The code inside in incomplete.


- `Colour_Generator` was my attempt at generating a colour picker. The various bugs lead to cool looking patterns.
