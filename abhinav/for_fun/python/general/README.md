# Directory Summary

Here are programs I wrote with no general purpose in mind.

- `3x+1.py` is based on a [video](https://youtu.be/094y1Z2wpJg?si=cZ_D7-_p6Wkkif56) by Veritasium. I wanted to see if I could also waste time on Collatz conjecture. 


- `DirectionGame.py` is an RPG that I made when initially learning to use Python.


- `Math_Quiz.py` is a quiz designed to improve artithemetic calculation speed.


- `Numbername.py` returns the number name for any given input.


- `PalindromeDetector.py` does exactly what the name suggests.


- `Print_Given_Table_1line.py` is a one line code that prints the entire multiplicative table of any given number.
