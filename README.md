# Repo Summary

This repository started out as a way to store my project files, but have now evolved to a lot more than just that to include all sorts of files. 

**Find  my major projects in this folder [here](https://github.com/Abhinav-Kamatamu/Abhi/tree/master/abhinav/for_fun/python).**

Any file you find that is encoded is probably not meant for the public to see.
